# funkybunch

Like Mark Whalberg, Markdown can be made better with funkybunch.

A project to provide extended capabilities for markdown, inspired by [jdan/cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver). Name based on [Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marky_Mark_and_the_Funky_Bunch).

## Goals

* [ ] Support standard markdown
* [ ] Support slideshows like [cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver)
* [ ] Add some of the Vuepress features like [custom containers](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#custom-containers)
* [ ] Code with syntax highlighting
* [ ] [YAML Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter)
